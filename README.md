# PhD Hub Graduate Assistant Test

This README contains an overview of the changes I have made to the existing NYU Professional Development for PhD Students Leadership page and the reasons for doing so. Thank you so much for taking the time to review these updates. I would love to leverage your feedback to work on developing other web pages and websites for NYU Tandon's PhD Hub.

Please find the updated webpage at this [link](https://siddharth1010.github.io/PhD-Hub-Skills-Test/)

# Workshop Gallery

## Event Cards

<p align="justify">
Currently, the cards are designed in such a way that a single row takes up almost the entirety of the browser's screen. This has been updated to ensure that the user can get more information while reducing their scroll effort. At an initial glance, the card contains only the title and host of the event. Interested users can hover over the card to get other information including the time, location and venue.

## Registering for events

<p align="justify">
Currently, the register buttom resides at the bottom of the webpage which makes it difficult to access in case there are several events. The user would have to scroll all the way to the bottom even if they find an interesting event on the top of the page. To eliminate this, I have added register buttons to each card individually.

## Quick Detail Cards

<p align="justify">
If the user is interested in the title of an event, they would like to know more about its overall goal. The brochure button links the user to a .pdf file which moves them to a separate browser tab. Several open tabs may not be easy for a user to naviagte. Additionally, the user may want to know a brief description of the event before taking a look at the brochure for the complete agenda. Quick detail cards offer the opportunity to add brief information regarding the event. Although ideally, it would be kept brief and simple, extra content will be handled in such a way that it does not overflow from the card.

# Auto Scroll

<p align="justify">
Most websites currently have a button that enables users to scroll back to the top of the screen effortlessly. I have added a similar button the enhance the quality of user experience.

</p>

# Alert Box

<p align="justify">
Currently, the alert section of the webpage resides at the bottom along with the regsiter button. In case there are many event, the user may not come across it and may thereby register for events without understanding the conditions and other requirements. Having a dismissable alert at the beginning of the page will ensure that users notice them as soon as the page loads.

# Header and Footer

<p align="justify">
The header and footer have been replicated as follows the design principles and colour codes as NYU Tandon's official website. The existing sub-header containing the links of the path followed to the current webpage is a really nice touch and has a very specific purpose.
